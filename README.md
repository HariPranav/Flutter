## Containers in Flutter :
  
    - A container in flutter is similar to a div in web development 
    - A container is a single view widget which can contain only a single **child** 
    - margin : EdgeInsets.all() is used to align a particular container on the screen
    - padding : EdgeInsets.all() is used to align the contengts of a continer and not the container itself.
